Apply the updates listed in the 'updates' array below in chronological order, based on the 'date' field of each entry. 3. For each update, execute the changes specified in 'changes_made' by adding, modifying, or removing data in the corresponding sections of the Echo V3 JSON. 4. Preserve all prior data unless explicitly overwritten by an update. 5. After applying all updates, the resulting dataset represents the current state of Echo.",
